# How RiSH Works

Here’s how students work with RiSH mentors:

1️⃣ **Explore Mentors** — Browse volunteer mentors and their research interests.

2️⃣ **Pick Your Mentor** — Connect with the mentor whose experience matches your idea.

3️⃣ **Frame Your Idea** — Define your research question, hypothesis, and goals with your mentor’s help.

4️⃣ **Do the Work** — You do the literature review, data collection, experiments, and writing.

5️⃣ **Get Feedback** — Your mentor provides feedback and advice throughout.

6️⃣ **Publish** — Together you prepare your paper for submission.

🚫 **Note:** RiSH does *not* write papers for students; you must do the work.
